Jennifer Russ solved 30 anagrams.

These opportunities might motivate Jennifer to solve 31:

- Are the words becoming more difficult?
- Trackpad, click next. Not responding. x5
- Click You Win.  No response.  x2
- At first she asked if she was supposed to spell a word.
- At first she tapped the letters and selection letters.
- Is the black circle a pan?
- The letters "THIS" can spell "SHIT".  She chuckled, but asked if I wanted that.
